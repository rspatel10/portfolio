            I'm <span className="font-bold text-cyan-500">Kirtan Patel</span>, a passionate and curious learner, always excited

          <p>
            Currently in my third year of college, I'm balancing my studies with
            real-world experience and personal projects that challenge me to
            think differently and push my boundaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in continuous growth, whether it's by exploring new ideas,
            connecting with others in the field, or developing a balanced
            lifestyle that nurtures both mind and body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work and studies, Iâ€™m focused on building habits that
            sustain my journey, from fitness to mindful learning, and embracing
            every opportunity to learn something new.
